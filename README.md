Project 2 was a college football tailgate site. Basically a two model setup using mongoldb and the full CRUD and RESTful routes. In addition the login/authentication code has been added as well.

The concept was based on a few friends that are die-hard tailgaters. At times they tried to start a blog or Facebook page about it but it wasn’t consistent and it only contained highlights of their one team. I thought a sit that showed all sorts of tailgaters with ability to share & post images, stories, recipes; etc would be a good candidate for this full stack project,

   Initial build was one in atom. Much of our labs & practice was referenced to build the controllers, views, and server.js. This took a lot of time and trial and error. But slowly things started connecting. 

   Later login info was added. First attempt things went horribly wrong, but after clearing out the old code, and trying again, got that to work to which was a good thing. I even made a point to have an entry page before you could go the ‘second’ home page. 

    CSS was a combination of flex, bootstrap, and vanilla. I liked taking more time to improve the look. I got more comfortable as time went by but there is still lots to learn to be really efficient with it.
